"""Deploy gate: decide whether a Fly deploy may proceed for a commit.

Background — the race this fixes
--------------------------------
The Fly deploy (``.github/workflows/deploy.yml``) is gated on THREE required
workflows all being green for the *same* commit on ``main``: ``CI``, ``Tests``,
and ``E2E (axe + parity)``. Each of the three completing fires the deploy via
``workflow_run``.

The previous gate *skipped* whenever a required workflow was still in progress
and relied on the LAST-finishing workflow's trigger to be the one that deploys.
When that last trigger did not produce a landing deploy (a dropped
``workflow_run`` event, a concurrency-cancel interaction), the commit was
*merged but silently never deployed* under a green "Deploy success" — exactly
what happened to PR #44 (the Fly-volume mount): the fast checks (~40s) ran the
gate before the ~3-minute E2E finished, so every trigger that fired skipped, and
no trigger deployed.

The fix here
------------
The gate no longer skips-and-hopes. It **waits** (bounded poll) for every
required workflow to reach a terminal conclusion for the SHA, then proceeds iff
ALL succeeded. This removes the dependency on *which* trigger fires last: the
earliest-arriving trigger simply waits for the rest.

Decision rules (fail-safe — never deploy what we cannot positively verify):

* Any required workflow concluded non-``success`` (failure/cancelled/…): STOP
  immediately, do not deploy.
* All required workflows concluded ``success``: PROCEED.
* One or more still pending (queued / in progress / not yet visible via the REST
  API, or a transient ``gh api`` error): keep polling until they resolve or the
  overall ``timeout`` elapses. On timeout: do NOT deploy (unverified).
* ``workflow_dispatch``: the manual escape hatch — proceed immediately, ungated.

The core :func:`evaluate_gate` takes injectable ``fetch_conclusion`` / ``sleep``
/ ``monotonic`` collaborators so it is unit-tested with zero network and zero
real waiting (``tests/unit/test_deploy_gate.py``).
