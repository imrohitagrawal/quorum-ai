# Session Handoff

## Date/time
2026-08-14T02:34:49+05:30

## Latest narrative handoff
`docs/analysis/2026-08-11-session-handoff.md` — read this for full context before editing. **(3 days old** — if a newer session ran since then and its narrative handoff was archived without a replacement being written, this may be stale; check `docs/archive/` for a newer one.)

This file is a mechanical snapshot (branch/git-status/skill-route/live state) —
regenerated fresh every `make handoff`. The narrative above (what happened,
what's next, the traps) lives in the dated doc it points to, not here.

## Current branch/worktree
fix/p8-134

## Live state (measured fresh by this run, not hand-carried)
Run `make handoff` again for current numbers instead of trusting this file
once it ages -- every value below is read from git/gh/`/status` at
generation time, per #134.

- **`origin/main` tip:** `a316992bb9f6`
- **Last commit touching `src/`:** `fa3541a7c113`
- **Production vs. last `src/` commit:** unavailable: could not reach https://quorum-ai.fly.dev/status (last src/ commit is fa3541a)
- **pytest collected (no execution):** 2928
- **e2e lane spec counts:** invariants: 17, ops: 2, degraded: 1
- **Open issues:** 17
- **Changed-lines coverage:** not computed here -- `make diff-cover` shares
  coverage data with every pytest-invoking target and races with them if run
  concurrently (AGENTS.md rule 15), so this file does not run it. Run
  `make quality && make diff-cover DIFF_BASE=origin/main` for a current number.
- **Remote branches not merged into `origin/main`:**
- `fix/p1-313-log-redaction`
- `fix/p8-224`
- `fix/p8-224-check`

## Completed in this session
- Update manually before closing the session.

## Decisions made
- Update manually before closing the session.

## Assumptions recorded
- Update `docs/ASSUMPTIONS.md` when needed.

## Open questions
- Update `docs/13-open-questions.md` when needed.

## Durable records (this file is REGENERATED — it cannot hold session state)
Everything below the "Current phase" line is derived from `make skill-route`,
and this whole file is overwritten by `scripts/session_handoff.py`. Anything a
session needs to survive into the next one lives in a tracked doc instead:
- The narrative handoff linked above — what happened, what's next, the traps.
- `docs/analysis/R2-plan-review-findings.md` — **PHASE STATUS** is the
  authoritative phase, not the "Current phase" line above (which reports the
  factory router's view, overridden for R2 under AGENTS.md precedence #2).
- The current slice's handback, linked from that PHASE STATUS block.
- `docs/63-technical-debt-register.md` — accepted debt and what blocks what.

## Risks/blockers
- Update manually before closing the session.

## Validation run
```bash
make next
make skill-route
make validate
```

## Validation result
- Update after running checks.

## Next best action
Review production signals, incidents, support feedback, and product metrics. Propose the next iteration with evidence.

## Suggested next Codex prompt
```text
Continue from AGENTS.md, docs/00-factory-console.md, and docs/session-handoff.md.
Read the narrative handoff linked at the top of this file first -- it has the
real "what happened, what's next" context this mechanical file cannot hold.
Read the PHASE STATUS block in docs/analysis/R2-plan-review-findings.md and the
slice handback it links: the phase line in this file is the router's view, not
the authoritative one.
Do not redo completed work.
Use the recommended driver skill and reviewer skills from make skill-route.
Before editing, list the files you intend to modify.
